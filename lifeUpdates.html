        i've been trying to come up with a good introduction for this post but i've really got nothing and i figured it's probably best to just write anyway.
    <p>
        i just got back from my second shift as the night auditor at a hampton inn, i tried going to sleep right when i got back to robert's from work but sleep just isn't calling yet (and robert snores a little :p) I'm still in the process of figuring out what my new sleep schedule is going to look like. yesterday before work i slept from 3:45-7:40pm and i didn't hate how i felt afterwards... it gave me time to wake up fully and get ready with a little extra time to spare before i was off again at 9:50ish. though i think with the way i operate day to day and my typical sleeping schedule, i don't think it'll take long to adjust to my schedule. it seems we get groups of days off and on again so we'll see how things shake out as the weeks progress.
    <p>
        the job is going great though! i like the night audit shift a lot. it's a lot of repetitive tasks and minimal people. now someone did accidentally call 911 last night... but other than shit like that it's super chill and i have a ton of downtime. it's weird to be apart of the workforce. i live in nebraska, i commute to omaha on i80, then i come home and autism out mostly. for some reason i still carry school stress in my body, but i'm not even on break anymore like i'm just some asshole with a job... it's just been weird to cope with honestly. it's not some crazy transition but like in my life in general it does feel like a big shift i have to adjust to. it's been hard to feel a sense of purpose i guess. there's a lot of aspects of my life going well but i still feel hollow inside. i think it's been hard to actually give up the life path i was so excited to continue. grad school drained the life out of me and i have no idea how to be around my friends still in school. i don't know if that's selfish or not but what am i now to them? the failure whose life imploded in the most embarrassing way possible? now i don't make eye contact as it is, but i feel nauseous just thinking about being around them and looking them in the eyes. i hope that passes but i have a feeling it won't.

        i guess i'll talk about a good update now since i've bummed myself out there. now i mean this in the most respectful way possible but it's so Weird to have a boyfriend.. i think my parents are more confused than i am tbh. i just like him so much and i am so tired of sorting my identity with a fine tooth comb.. it's exhausting and like what is the point of constantly second guessing my feelings? what am i actually looking for? a label? or a reason to sabotage good things in my life? you will never catch me calling myself bisexual though.. i don't even have actual beef with bisexual people but i'd rather just chill for a while and stay unlabeled in the meantime. my sexuality is one big question mark.

        but anyway, i just really enjoy my time with robert. i'm resisting the urge to meticulously define our relationship but whatever it is, i'm really happy. we've been... seeing each other... for 3 months now but he asked me on christmas day what we are, mostly joking, but we did establish that we are indeed dating. he truly is one of the most interesting people i've ever met, his brain is full of so much stuff and so many thoughts... like with breanna, she was just not very opinionated nor did she really ever have much to contribute to things i said. sometimes it felt like i was talking to a wall. i would get this feeling that breanna knows all this stuff about me, listens to me all the time, but she never had much input. like i never actually knew her. i'm realizing now that she just didn't have much depth as a person and i don't think i want to be with someone like that again. i like being around someone that will die on many hills :p someone that has constructive and substantial input in conversations, you know? he also just does so many little things that makes me aware that he thinks about me and cares about me. i fear getting into the specifics would make it seem like i'm swooning over the bare minimum, but he really is so thoughtful and gentle and kind in ways that make me feel special. like the other night was my first night auditing shift and he walked me to my car and carried my bag and sent me off in person. he was so excited for me and it made my whole night. that's one example of many, but little gestures like that mean a lot to me :,) time slows when we're together, we're always laughing together, and i love learning his little quirks the more time we spend together. i got to see his childhood home and meet his entire family.. sometimes things feel too real and i get stressed over someone getting to know me fully, but i feel so calm and safe around him. he probably knows me too well but it's nice to feel seen and important when i can barely face myself and my own reality. things work out a lot nicer when i actually let myself enjoy them fully, and i'm just happy we exist together in the same place, however long that'll be.
