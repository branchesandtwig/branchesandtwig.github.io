    <p>
        i've had something bouncing around my mind a lot recently. i'm currently very high and i took an adderall at like 6 pm so that i could lock in on driving to missouri for weed :p so it's kind of the perfect time to make a post.    <p>
    <p>
        warning, my thoughts are bit disorganized so please read the entire thing all the way through before you read into and make assumptions based on the way i phrase and talk about certain stuff in this post specifically. i am very autistic and process and navigate my emotions and friendships/relationships atypically. this post is a general overview of my relationships, it's not specifically about a single individual    <p>
    <p>
        but something i feel like has come into question recently is if i'm gay or not. i guess more specifically, a lesbian. ultimately at the end of the day, no matter how much or how little i want to explain it, i am still a lesbian. to get into the specifics, i'm also asexual (like for realsies) and i don't experience emotional/romantic attraction through sex. it was weird to finally find words (and a label) to describe this feeling, but it makes sense in my brain. i think it's definitely related to childhood sexual trauma, but i spent a lot of time feeling broken in some indescribable way because i just didn't experience this "soul-bonding" feeling from sexual intimacy in my romantic relationships. it doesn't fulfill me in the way it does for other people with their partners. some people prioritize sex in their relationships (which i'm completely fine with btw lol) but it's not something that i factor in when it comes to whether or not i am romantically attracted to a person. it's not that i don't enjoy it or am unable to form bonds through that kind of intimacy, it's just not something i really consider when i find myself becoming attracted to someone if that makes sense.     <p>
    <p>
        the reason this has become a relevant topic of conversation recently is because of who i'm currently hooking up with. i won't get too much into the specifics of that (or him), but my opinions of and feelings for him are not influenced by the physical intimacy we share. i don't think sexuality is a choice, but i think the experiences you pursue are something you do get to choose. for me specifically, my sexual identity has been heavily influenced by my experiences with men. exploring and identifying with lesbianism has filled a void within me, it changed my perception of the world and myself. decentering men and pursuing only emotionally intimate relationships with women has completely changed the way i operate in the world for the better. the tenderness, intimacy, and shared female experience has allowed me to form bonds i've never been able to experience fully before. it has given me the space and safety to better understand myself. i'm sure there exists some dude out there that does have the capacity to love me the way i desire, but the overwhelming negative and misogynystic experiences i've had with men so far is something i no longer want to subject myself to in order to find this hypothetical perfect man.     <p>
    <p>
        none of those feelings have changed, but i will say that dealing with the aftermath of a lesbian breakup has been incredibly draining and hard to navigate. i have a lot of personal feelings about myself and the way i navigate romantic relationships in general and i just don't have the energy or space to pursue a new one right now. with anyone of any gender in any way. the current !!casual!! situation i have with robert is completely separate from that. it's something that i actually have the capacity for. i enjoy the space he currently occupies in my life and i want to enjoy it without dissecting what it means regarding my identity. i spent the last 5 fucking years obsessing over the semantics and details of gender and sexual identity, i just want to take a break from all of that and enjoy whatever the hell i'm currently doing. this past year i've spent so much time grieving the parts of myself that didn't make it to nebraska. i feel like i am still attached to tennessee in ways that make it difficult to figure out who i am here. the experience i've had with robert so far is like the first thing that's felt exclusive to my life in nebraska and i don't want to sabotage that when it feels like a positive thing, you know?    <p>
    <p>
        bad experiences with men, acts of sexual violence in particular, have absolutely influenced my relationship with lesbianism. i used to regularly have panic attacks during sex. i was repeatedly assaulted by my last boyfriend because it was easier to let him use me than to say no which always led to an argument. he never stopped when i was completely limp and dissociated from my body. he never noticed when i would start crying. he made me want to crawl out of my skin. every time we had sex i would scrub my skin in the shower until it was raw and bleeding to get his touch off me. alex is genuinely one of the most manipulative and evil men i've ever had the displeasure of knowing.    <p>
    <p>
        in contrast, robert has made me feel completely safe and seen in a way i've never experienced with anyone really. for the first time i have been able to experience pleasure without dissociating. i don't think anyone else has been as kind and attentive as he's been. i just don't see a good reason to deny myself of this experience, and honestly it's been healing in ways i wasn't fully aware of. instead of feeling like my physical form is the biggest burden of my existence that i can't escape from, i get to enjoy the somatic experience of being a person. it used to be incredibly difficult to get out of my head enough to enjoy sex, and now i can enjoy it completely sober. i just don't think i owe anyone an explanation about it.      <p>
    <p>   
        i don't particularly care about people's perception or opinions on the entire situation, but i do want to address one comment in particular that completely crossed a line. someone brought up the fact that breanna cheated on me with a straight man and he was wondering how my situation was different. first of all, my breakup with breanna is not up for interpretation or investigating. i was not given the luxury of being able to grieve and process that loss privately and it is incredibly fucked up to bring that up so casually with so much contempt. the ending of my 3 year lesbian relationship is not some gotcha to throw in my fucking face when i do something that doesn't align with someone's perception or definitions of queer identities. there is no way to ask that in a way that's not malicious or inherently misogynystic. and second of all, i didn't cheat on my long-term girlfriend after falling in love with a man in a month. so i'm not sure how the situations are related. i didn't denounce lesbianism, completely avoiding the term and uniquely lesbian experiences to pursue a man. it's not the same thing and i'm so fucking tired of being judged and perceived through that lense or framing. i am done with breanna. i am done being watered down and defined by that relationship. i truly didn't feel this strongly about it until my sexuality was questioned like that. it's still so insane to me that anyone could have the audacity to interrogate me like that. idgaf what people think in their own minds nor if people think i'm a huge hypocrite... like i'm still dedicated to biphobia. trust me, no one hates bisexual people more than me!
    <p>
        to sum up all my word vomit, i just want to be able to enjoy the current things in my life that make me feel safe in my body and mind, whatever those things may be. and that shouldn't have to be explained or scrutinized.
