    <p>
        i'm currently in my office not doing the work i'm supposed to be doing :p i'm actually thinking about the discussion today in my gender studies class. 
    <p>
        we talked about gender as a social construct and it's weird to be amongst peers that are just now discovering who they are and how they identify. i'm not saying i'm completely figured out myself, but i came out as agender in 2019 and spent 5 years using they/them. i have experienced more than them in general (i say that very neutrally) and it's interesting to see where our discussions go in class. some are learning that blindly agreeing with all opinions they come across in queer spaces online doesn't quite hold in a room of people. i prefer in person conversations, i just wish i wasn't the only 24 year old sometimes. 
    <p>
        it's mostly got me thinking about why i changed my pronouns back to she/her and what that means for me and for those who perceive me. ultimately i am still agender and still have the same feelings i've had for the past 5 years (for the most part), but what was difficult for me was figuring out how to express myself in a way that made me feel comfortable in my own body and shifted away from the fact that i'm a girl. 
    <p>
        i think at the beginning of my transition i wanted to stop being a girl so bad and although i've never really seen myself that way ever really in my life, i couldn't figure out how to get other people to stop casting me in a role i never auditioned for. that was really the priority for a while. i cut my hair really short, wore androgynous stuff, and tried to distance myself from femininity as a whole. it left me hollow and confused mostly. i was focusing too much on the semantics of pronouns and identity labels; i've now realized that i was afraid of who i really was and the work it was going to take to understand myself. i think that mostly stemmed from deep rooted self hatred that is still taking a long time to heal from.
    <p>
        so what led to the pronoun switch? well using gender non-conforming labels, pronouns specifically, is an open invitation to a kind of vulnerability most people are not used to or will never have to experience. i barely knew anything about myself, how am i supposed to answer the question "what made you decide to change your pronouns?" most questions are asked in good faith or out of genuine curiosity. i think spending time in a very conservative area of Tennessee desensitized me to invasive questions and comments; i was more concerned with helping people approach the idea of gender non-conformity with less hostility and more curiosity. i walked a fine line between being a respectable gay friend/coworker and being the pc police if you will :P
    <p>
        in general, i'm a pretty abrasive person; i'm more equipped to handle conversations with people who have black and white thinking about that kind of thing. but what do you do about the folk who think they've done the internal work to be a good ally when in reality they don't respect you as an individual at all? 
    <p>
        i've always been aware of how misogyny affects my life and how it operates in society in general, but dealing with "woke" folk who have no idea how harmful their mindset and worldview truly is regardless of their intentions is an entirely different battle. like just call me a dyke at this point and move on with your day.. but seriously i was unprepared for this specific kind of person which is very prevalent here in Nebraska. 
    <p>
        i began hating the way people said my name and talked about me. i hated the way i was being treated. i hated hearing "they" come out of people's mouths. everything felt wrong and i felt like i was being probed on an operating table with no anesthesia and no way to get through to anyone. i think using they/them for 5 years gave me the space to understand who i am and how i want to represent myself to the world. it was a safe place off the main stage to explore femininity. i had felt disconnected from womanhood and girlhood and i didn't like the woman i was becoming nor the woman i was made out to be.
    <p>
        coming out in my department was extremely isolating but it made it much more clear who respected me and who just tolerated my existence. i have always struggled with knowing who i can trust and who actually likes me and respects me, so this made it much easier for me to know who was worth my time and energy. as i came to terms with the ways autism affects me, other parts of me i was never able to embrace or understand came to the surface to process. i became more comfortable with decentering men and embracing lesbianism, i was able to make progress with body neutrality and finally start accepting and loving my physical body, and i started gaining more experience and vocabulary to help others understand queer experiences and identities. in those 5 years i was able to achieve more internal growth than i ever thought possible. 
    <p>
        the break up with breanna is what made me seriously start considering going back to she/her. we had an argument involving lesbianism and at some point she said to me "well it must be important to you since you keep bringing it up" and that message felt like a bullet through my chest to be completely honest. i remember when i realized that being a lesbian encapsulates both my sexual and gender identity. i'm not a woman, i'm a lesbian! she was there when i made this discovery and for the first time it felt like i had discovered something about myself that made sense and made me feel like an entire human being. so yes, it is important to me. and the person who supposedly knew me best suddenly had no idea who i was at all. if being vulnerable with the person who i wanted to spend my life with ended up biting me in the ass, what was being vulnerable with every person i encounter really doing other than make me feel hollow from the inside out? 
    <p>
        using they/them and learning what being transgender means for me in my brain and body has allowed me to finally feel comfortable as erin. i am still agender and i am still every erin that has ever been and ever will be. i will continue to make a safe home for all the erins in this body but i think i'm ready to close the doors and let them finally rest with the privacy and dignity they deserve but never received. 
    <p>
        my priorities have shifted and now that i feel safer in my body and have a better idea of who i am fundamentally, i have become way more aware of how pervasive misogyny is in my day to day life. beyond being a lesbian, as a woman i have a lot of experiences that have shaped my perception of the world and i think i was taken less seriously when i was actively avoiding the role of a woman. my journey and experiences within womanhood didn't cease to exist when i denounced gender altogether, but it was harder to explain the nuances of my relationship with womanhood when i was simultaneously trying to opt out of gender completely. those things aren't inherently contradictory, but they started conflicting for me the more i explored critical feminist and gender theory. i am not concerned with how others define me and my experiences as much as i am concerned with understanding just how much our society hates women and the ways systemic misogyny functions.. but that's a bigger conversation for a future blog post. 
    <p>
        in conclusion... i'm saving my pronouns for marriage. but in all seriousness, loving women and committing to lesbianism has allowed me to feel so much more comfortable as a woman myself. i feel safe around women and as i'm starting to create a safe place in my mind and body, identifying as a woman again just feels right to me.
    <p>
        if you made it this far.. wow thank you for reading my brain vomit. feel free to share your thoughts with me here in the comments or the next time you see me.

<p>
oh geez.. i haven't written a blog post in months. i'm currently at work trying not to lose my mind. not any reason in particular.. though i think i'm losing my marbles a little bit all the time if i'm being honest. just leaving a little trail of marbles everywhere i go... 
<p>
i wish i had something interesting to talk about. there's very little going on in my life and i don't know.. i feel very mixed about it. on one hand it's super nice to have nothing going on, all i really have to do is go to work and pay my bills. this is probably the most peaceful my life has been in a very long time. my idea of peace is rather relative, but i don't feel overwhelmed every second of the day which does feel like a vast improvement from the last.... like 12 years? lol
<p>
but really the most noteworthy thing is that i've been clean from self harm for 10 months today. i know that's something worth celebrating.. something to be proud of i guess. at the end of the day progress is progress, i've fought the urges for 10 months straight which is something i never imagined was really possible for me. it doesn't exactly feel like an achievement though. i think about self harm every. single. day. i miss the ritual.. i miss the physical sensation.. i miss the way it made me feel. and in some weird masochistic way, i miss having fresh scars. i get sad seeing my faded scars, not because i have them but because they are literally fading away. i look at the pictures i have of my own fresh cuts and i wish i could go back in time and experience them again. on a bad day, my old scars are triggering because it just makes me want more of them. 
<p>
i used to do "experiments" on myself in middle/high school because i was fascinated with the healing process. i'd put neosporin on half of them or cover some of them with a bandaid just to see how different aftercare methods affected scar formation. i was obsessed with figuring out how to create atrophic and hypertrophic scars. at my worst, i'd reopen fresh wounds 3+ times a day and then put some layer of clothing over them so i could peel it off later and reopen the wounds that way. i knew exactly how long they took to heal and all the different phases of scar formation. i hate that i miss that period of my life so much.. not exactly the circumstances during that time lol but just the freedom of going into my room at night and adding 50+ scars to my body in one session. 
<p>
i feel so empty without it to be completely honest. it's hard to talk about because i've never really met someone who truly understands what a self harm addiction feels like. there is literally not a single thing that has come close to giving me the same rush. i'm happy that my meds have stopped me from having to act on every urge to self harm, but i can't shake the emptiness i feel without it. being 10 months free of the urge would be the real achievement. if only i could go 10 months without thinking my body would look better with open wounds. 10 months of feeling safe having knives in my home would be nice. i'd love to feel comfortable in my body as my scars fade away, but it just feels like i'm continually losing these little pieces of me i don't want to let go of. in a lot of ways, i don't feel like i am truly 10 months clean. it's such a unique and isolating experience. an inescapable feeling.
<p>
i hate to sound dismissive or apathetic, but i hate when people tell me i should be proud or that i've come a long way. sure, i haven't actually put a knife to my skin, but almost every single day i think about how if i stay clean, i'll never experience something that makes me feel as good as cutting does again. and i don't know what makes me feel worse, someone who has never cut themselves telling me they're proud of me or an ex-cutter telling me that. i hate to be callous, but either way it feels like such an empty gesture. it mostly upsets me because cutting is a socially unacceptable form of addiction... doesn't exactly feel meaningful coming from smokers of any form that are actively destroying their lungs or from functioning alcoholics that are slowly destroying their insides. cutting doesn't cause cancer... it won't make my organs fail. there are people that need a tattoo every time they experience a hardship in life because they like the pain of the needle, and will gladly admit that! i just don't see why cutting is so much worse than those things. my scars only affect my appearance really. i'm aware that's just the addiction talking, but i guess in some ways i just don't understand why my addiction holds so much more weight, why it's so much more imperitive that i curb my addiction. that's why i get so frustrated talking about it.
<p>
i didn't exactly mean for this to turn into just venting about self harm and my particular struggles with it, but it's just been clogging up my mind for so long. i feel so alone in this. just filled to the brim with shame and disgust about it. i should be thinking about my career.. my future.. the people in my life that i cherish so deeply and yet all i can think about is how good it feels to mutilate my body and how much i miss it. not exactly sure what to do with all these feelings.
